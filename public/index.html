		<h2><em>O</em>ur<em> S</em>tory</h2>
		<p>
		We were just txtmate then, where night becomes morning and morning becomes night. We talked about everything and i was so amazed  of your youthful energy towards things.  Funny experiences during your college days and stufidity of being young. I was so captivated by your charming voice and I often asked you to sing a song for me. Our relationship is a product of unli call and txt.:)  4am sleeping time then become a normal sleeping habit for us. We usually talked about relationships and how optimistic you are in expressing your opinion. I started to admire and love you for that. I dont see any hesitation from you to enter into a relationship but rather the excitement to spend it to someone you love so much. The willingness to go whatever lenght even if its you and I against the world. I admire your spirit and the more i fall in love with you.</p>

		<p>Trials came that challenged us. I made you cry and said goodbye. Then came destiny...by unexplanable things our path has crossed again. Singapore! Believe it or not, its destiny isnt it?:) life changed from that day on. </p>

		<p>All those late night conversation we had back then, about living together started to come in and for a short period of time we were able to experience all of it. We were given the chance to live together and its not always paradise. We do fights. We shouted, which i accept i often do to you. You always wacked my patience and challenge the evil side of me. We do have a lots of trials that both of us go through we it with heads high. I often say to you,"Its not important what other people says about us, about our relationship but rather what is important is the two of us, that we are ok. Its only us that knows about how we are in this relationship and no other else in this world". We hang on despite the age gap (11 years), the immaturity ( you have), different views and opinion in analyzing things. We fights like its the end of the world, hurting each other verbally and even  to a point of saying goodbye... (Goodbye but not more than 24 hrs. Hehehe)</p>

		<p>We appreciate the beauty of saying sorry and the importance of patience. We then slowly accept each others imperfection and started to compromise things. We grow together in this relationship and at the same time we grow each other individually. All of this the more we admire and love each other. </p>

		<p>Today as we celebrate our 1st year anniversary, I want you to know that from the day I give you that ring I commit my life to you. I will be yours and you will be mine. 

		<p>Happy anniversary baby!!! I love you so much more than anything.:)</p>
